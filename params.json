{"name":"Pillow","tagline":"Pillow is the \"friendly\" PIL fork","body":"Pillow\r\n======\r\n\r\nPillow is the \"friendly\" PIL fork, created by Alex Clark. PIL is the Python Imaging Library, created by Fredrik Lundh.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe fork author's goal is to foster active development of PIL through:\r\n\r\n- Publicized development activity\r\n- Solicitation for community contributions\r\n- Regular releases to the Python Packaging Index\r\n\r\nWhy a fork?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nPIL is not setuptools compatible. Please see http://mail.python.org/pipermail/image-sig/2010-August/006480.html for a more detailed explanation. Also, PIL's current bi-yearly (or greater) release schedule is too slow to address the large number of issues regularly reported.\r\n\r\nWhat about image code bugs?\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease report any non-packaging related issues here first:\r\n\r\n- https://bitbucket.org/effbot/pil-2009-raclette/issues \r\n\r\nThen open a ticket here:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow/issues\r\n\r\nand provide a link to the first ticket so we can track the issue(s) upstream.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe API documentation included with PIL has been converted (from HTML) to\r\nreStructured text (via pandoc) and is now `hosted by readthedocs.org <http://pillow.readthedocs.org>`_.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is the PIL 1.1.7 README contents.\r\n\r\nPython Imaging Library\r\n======================\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities\r\nto your Python environment.  This library provides extensive file\r\nformat support, an efficient internal representation, and powerful\r\nimage processing capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis source kit has been built and tested with Python 2.0 and newer,\r\non Windows, Mac OS X, and major Unix platforms.  Large parts of the\r\nlibrary also work on 1.5.2 and 1.6.\r\n\r\nThe main distribution site for this software is:\r\n\r\n        http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/\r\n\r\nThat site also contains information about free and commercial support\r\noptions, PIL add-ons, answers to frequently asked questions, and more.\r\n\r\nDevelopment versions (alphas, betas) are available here:\r\n\r\n        http://effbot.org/downloads/\r\n\r\nThe PIL handbook is not included in this distribution; to get the\r\nlatest version, check:\r\n\r\n        http://www.pythonware.com/library/\r\n\r\nFor installation and licensing details, see below.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSupport Options\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCommercial Support\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nSecret Labs (PythonWare) offers support contracts for companies using\r\nthe Python Imaging Library in commercial applications, and in mission-\r\ncritical environments.  The support contract includes technical support,\r\nbug fixes, extensions to the PIL library, sample applications, and more.\r\n\r\nFor the full story, check:\r\n\r\n        http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/support.htm\r\n\r\n\r\nFree Support\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nFor support and general questions on the Python Imaging Library, send\r\ne-mail to the Image SIG mailing list:\r\n\r\n        image-sig@python.org\r\n\r\nYou can join the Image SIG by sending a mail to:\r\n\r\n        image-sig-request@python.org\r\n\r\nPut \"subscribe\" in the message body to automatically subscribe to the\r\nlist, or \"help\" to get additional information.  Alternatively, you can\r\nsend your questions to the Python mailing list, python-list@python.org,\r\nor post them to the newsgroup comp.lang.python.  DO NOT SEND SUPPORT\r\nQUESTIONS TO PYTHONWARE ADDRESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSoftware License\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSee COPYING\r\n","google":"UA-38862712-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
